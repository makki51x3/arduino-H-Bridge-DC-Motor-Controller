# arduino-H-Bridge-DC-Motor-Controller
This circuit contains an Arduino UNO, motor, AC Adapter (9V), 2 push buttons, and an H-Bridge.

When pressing the first push button, the motor should reach its maximum speed within 2 seconds. After that, when we press the second push button, the motor should turn off within 2 seconds. However, if we press the first push button while the motor is on, or if we press the second one while the motor is off nothing should happen.
